# api-node

API for Gueno Challenge made using Express framework

-   Run "npm install" or "npm i" to install dependencies

-   Create .env file using the .env.example as a model. Here you need to add your local configuration (is recommended to leave the same settings as the .env.example file).

-   To start the server, run "npm run start". This will run the command "nodemon app.js --exec babel-node --". This project uses ES6, so Babel and Nodemon will be needed to run the app.

-   To check the documentation for this API, go to http://localhost:3000 (after starting the server). IMPORTANT: the URL will be different if you set a HOST and PATH different than "localhost" and "3000" on the .env file
